C++ Program to simulate the First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin, and SRTF sceduling algorithms used by a process scheduler.
Program takes in an input file with the format: Process ID, burst time, arrival time.
It then puts them into a queue based on arrival time and then simulates each algorithm.
It then displays them out as a Gantt chart and shows the turnaround times and the waiting times for each process as well as the average.
